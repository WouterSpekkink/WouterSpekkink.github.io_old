  A quick way to visualise the results is to use the tool to export the node
  list and edge list, and import these into Gephi. Importing of the edge list
  and node list should be done from Gephiâ€™s data laboratory. The user should
  make sure that the order variables of the node list are imported as numeric
  variables (doubles are the safest option, but integers should also work in
  most situations). To make useful plots of the results, the user should make
  sure to also install the Event Graph Layout (this can be done from within the
  Plugins menu of Gephi). The user should then select one of the order variables
  as the order variable for the Event Graph Layout plugin. The Actor variable
  can be used to give nodes colours based on the actors associated with them.
  This allows one to more easily spot lineages in the graph.
