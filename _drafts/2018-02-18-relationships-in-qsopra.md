## Introduction
An important principle in the philosophy that underlies Q-SoPrA is that social processes are inextricably intertwined with social structures. In this sense, Q-SoPrA connects rather well to social theories that posit some type of interplay between *agency and structure*. The work of [Giddens][1] on the duality of structure is probably one of the most famous examples. Personally, I currently try to use [Schatzki's][2] concepts of *practices* and *arrangements* to conceptualise relationships between agency and structure. 

There are of course numerous perspectives on how agency and structure are related, and different theories therefore offer different approaches. In my view, one general, very important distinction that can be made is between (1) theories that assume the primacy of structure over process, and (2) theories that assume the primacy of process over structure (see [this book by Rescher][3]).  

, and the design of Q-SoPrA is based on a particular stance in this.
