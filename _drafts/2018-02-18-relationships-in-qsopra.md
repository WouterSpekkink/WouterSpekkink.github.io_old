## Preface: Process and structure
An important principle in the philosophy that underlies Q-SoPrA is that social processes are inextricably intertwined with social structures. In this sense, Q-SoPrA connects rather well to social theories that posit some type of interplay between *agency and structure* (as the title of this section suggests, I actually prefer to distinguish between *process and structure*). The work of [Giddens][1] on the duality of structure is probably one of the most famous examples. Personally, I currently try to use [Schatzki's][2] concepts of *practices* and *arrangements* to conceptualise social process, social structure, and their relationships. 

There are of course numerous perspectives on how process and structure are related, and different theories therefore offer different approaches. In my view, one general, very important distinction that can be made is between (1) theories that fundamentally assume the *primacy of structure over process*, and (2) theories that fundamentally assume the *primacy of process over structure* (see [this book by Rescher][3]). Some would probably accuse me of oversimplifying here, but I would argue that functionalist social theories are an example of the former category, since they tend to presuppose the existence of a social system, and see process in terms of functions being carried out by parts of systems. Examples of the second category are relational sociological theories, which typically assume that relationships (and structures of relationships) are constituted through interactions/transactions. 

My own current stance is currently structures presuppose processes, and that the analysis of social phenomena should focus first and foremost on how these phenomena are continuously (re)produced. That being said, I see little value in exercises that involve the radical deconstruction of literally everything we encounter into events. I tend to assume that doing so is always possible, but I also believe that it is not always useful, depending on the research questions at hand. 

I like to model structures as networks of relationships between entities. In doing so, I basically reify the entities as well as their relationships; a more complete description of the countless developments that entities and relationships go through could of course be provided through, for example, narratives. However, the point of using networks as models (at least, in my use case) is to focus on those aspects of entities and relationships that tend to persist over extended periods of time.
