I"T<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="/software/sopra/technical/2017/12/21/a-better-csv-parser.html">my previous post</a>, I am currently working on an integrated software package for the qualitative study of social processes, called Q-SoPrA (<strong>Q</strong>ualitative <strong>So</strong>cial <strong>Pr</strong>ocess <strong>A</strong>nalysis). The program can be used for various tasks, including data management, qualitative coding, and visualisation. It is still under construction, and I have not opened the source or distributed any binaries yet (but I will once a more or less fully-featured and stable version is ready). In addition to some more technical posts about the software (<a href="/software/sopra/technical/2017/12/21/a-better-csv-parser.html">such as the previous one</a>), I intend to write several non-technical posts, discussing the features of Q-SoPrA and how to use them. Eventually, most of this information will also be available from the GitHub wiki of Q-SoPrA, but I think having some less condensed discussions of features is also useful.</p>
