<p>Before I get to the main topic of this post, I should offer a bit of background. I am currently working on an integrated software package for the qualitative study of social processes, called Q-SoPrA (an acronym for <strong>So</strong>cial <strong>Pr</strong>ocess <strong>A</strong>nalysis). The program can be used for data entry, data management, hierarchical coding for attributes (think CAQDAS-style coding), coding for network relationships, coding for linkages between events (see the work of <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~socpsy/ESA/">David Heise</a> for a main source of inspiration in this), abstracting larger events from smaller ones, visualising event graphs, visualising event hierarchies, visualising network graphs, visualising occurrence graphs (similar to <a href="/software/2017/03/10/bi-dynamic-line-graphs.html">Bi-Dynamic Line Graphs</a>), and basic analysis. I intend to write some technical as well as non-technical posts about Q-SoPrA and its development. The technical posts will deal primarily with what happens on ‘the back stage’ of the program, that is, discuss the underlying source code. The non-technical posts will focus primarily on Q-SoPrA’s ‘front stage’, discussing its features and how to use them. This post is going to be a technical one.</p>
