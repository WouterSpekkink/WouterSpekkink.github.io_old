<p>During my PhD project I developed a fascination for geometric approaches to exploratory data analysis, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Correspondence Analysis. These methods have some very interesting applications. For example, they can help you to strongly reduce the dimensionality of datasets, capturing the most essential patterns in your data. I especially like the ways in which these methods can help you to visually explore concepts that can be captured in terms of ‘distances,’ such as (dis)similarities between people, social groups, events, and etcetera. I thought it would be nice to write a few posts in which I offer basic examples of the methods in use (without going into the technical details), using only open source software. In this post, I focus specifically on MDS, and I offer a basic demonstration of the method, using <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a>, two amazing pieces of software.</p>
