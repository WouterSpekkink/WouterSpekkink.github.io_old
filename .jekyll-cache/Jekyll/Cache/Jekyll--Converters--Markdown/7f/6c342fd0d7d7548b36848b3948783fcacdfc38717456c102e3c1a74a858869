I"Q<h2 id="mindblown">Mindblown</h2>
<p>When ChatGPT was first released, I barely took notice.
I heard some people say impressive things about ChatGPT, but I didn’t immediately feel the urge to try it out.
Eventually, a few months ago, I decided to give it a try.
I was mindblown.
For an entire week, I had ChatGPT spit out crazy, nonsensical stories.
There was one about a talking horse that specialized in public-private partnerships and saved a village by helping to create new infrastructure.
I remember one about a hero who rode his horse backwards because he was afraid of being followed by purple frogs.
There was also another one about someone who put themselves in orbit around the Earth by pulling themselves up by their own hair.
The funniest part was that ChatGPT added a disclaimer by the end, stating that it was purely fictional and that you cannot actually put yourself in orbit in this way.</p>

<p>I quickly started trying out things that might be useful for my work in academia.
For example, I had it come up with an assignment about analyzing policy interventions from a behavioral perspective.
Although I didn’t actually use it, I could have with just a few tweaks.
I also entered into discussions with ChatGPT about theories and philosophy.
I found ChatGPT to be a useful conversational partner on many topics, as long as you already know your stuff and can spot the things that ChatGPT gets wrong (which happens frequently; at some point, I got fed up with ChatGPT constantly apologizing for getting things wrong).
I even tried a hybrid of storytelling and conversation on theories, having ChatGPT tell a fictional story about an academic and then querying ChatGPT about the contents of the papers written by this fictional academic.</p>

<p>I don’t remember exactly when I started using ChatGPT for code writing, but its co-pilot capabilities are another aspect that blew me away and changed the way I write code. 
I recently read <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36855516">a post on hacker news</a> about how traffic on StackOverflow has declined recently. 
I have a strong suspicion that ChatGPT has contributed to this.</p>

<p>While I continue to be mindblow to this day (in a positive way), I would also like to note that, like many others, I have occasionally felt uncertain and worried about what this will all lead to.
I am certainly no expert on AI, so please take anything I say on this with a grain of salt.
That being said, I am not that concerned about the ‘AI going rogue’ scenario, because I think that tools like ChatGPT give the strong appearance of being intelligent, but in reality, they are as dumb as a bag of rocks. 
What I am more afraid of <a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/07/21/one-of-the-godfathers-of-ai-airs-his-concerns">what humans might do</a> with powerful tools like LLMs (or whatever comes next).”
Also, I feel somewhat uncomfortable with the fact that progress in this area is driven almost entirely by business interests.
I think it is important that we think of alternative models for the further development of AI, such as the ‘Island’ idea put forward in <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2">this article of the FT Magazine</a>
It is also encouraging to see initiatives such as the development of <a href="https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz">the Bloomz model</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals#benchmarks">petals</a> (my GPU is now hosting one block of a BloomZ model through petals; admittely an almost meaningless contribution), which are both initiatives of <a href="https://bigscience.huggingface.co/">BigScience</a>. 
However, this post will focus on some of what I believe to be positive changes that LLMs can bring to my own work in academia.</p>

<blockquote>
I'll reiterate that I am no expert on AI, and given that many people who are an expert on the topic are worried, probably means that I am overlooking or misunderstanding something.
Feel free to write me a message to educate me on this.
