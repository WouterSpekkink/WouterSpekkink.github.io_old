<p>As the name suggests, Q-SoPrA (<strong>Q</strong>ualitative <strong>So</strong>ftware for <strong>Pr</strong>ocess <strong>A</strong>nalysis) is focused first and foremost on the qualitative analysis of social <em>processes</em>. However, I invested a lot of time and energy in also creating features that can be used to study how these processes relate to <em>structures</em>. In my opinion, this is a somewhat obvious thing to do, since so many social theories posit some kind of relationship between process and structure (often couched in terms of <em>agency</em> and <em>structure</em>. I can use my own application of Q-SoPrA as an example. I am currently using Q-SoPrA in a study that, conceptually, builds on <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=753WUmtDIiwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Site+of+the+Social&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPvMuKta_ZAhWNLlAKHZz0DIMQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Site%20of%20the%20Social&amp;f=false">Schatzkiâ€™s</a> concepts of <em>social practices</em> (in short, organised doings and sayings) and <em>social arrangements</em> of people, artefacts, places, and other types of entities. I use event graphs to reconstruct practices as networks of activities (<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=753WUmtDIiwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Site+of+the+Social&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPvMuKta_ZAhWNLlAKHZz0DIMQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Site%20of%20the%20Social&amp;f=false">Schatzki</a> also writes about <em>chains of action</em> in this context), and I use more traditional network graphs to reconstruct arrangements as networks of relationships between entities. One aspect of my investigation is to study how unfolding practices relate to (changes in) arrangements.</p>
