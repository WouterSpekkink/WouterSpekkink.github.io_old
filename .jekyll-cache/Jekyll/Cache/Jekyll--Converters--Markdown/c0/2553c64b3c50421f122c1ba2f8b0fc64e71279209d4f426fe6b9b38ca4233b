I"è<h2 id="mindblown">Mindblown</h2>
<p>When ChatGPT was first released, I barely took notice.
I heard some people say impressive things about ChatGPT, but I didn‚Äôt immediately feel the urge to try it out.
Eventually, a few months ago, I decided to give it a try.
I was mindblown.
For an entire week, I had ChatGPT spit out crazy, nonsensical stories.
There was one about a talking horse that specialized in public-private partnerships and saved a village by helping to create new infrastructure.
I remember one about a hero who rode his horse backwards because he was afraid of being followed by purple frogs.
There was also another one about someone who put themselves in orbit around the Earth by pulling themselves up by their own hair.
The funniest part was that ChatGPT added a disclaimer by the end, stating that it was purely fictional and that you cannot actually put yourself in orbit in this way.</p>
