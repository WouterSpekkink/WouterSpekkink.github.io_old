<p>I wrote a non-technical post on <a href="/software/q-sopra/non-technical/2018/02/21/relationships-in-qsopra.html">relationships in Q-SoPrA</a>. One of the things I discuss there is plotting parallel edges, that is, multiple edges between the same pair of nodes. This is something I definitely wanted to be able to do, since I am interested in looking at social arrangements (of people, places, things, etc.) that can be related to each other in various ways. If I want to look at multiple relationships at the same time, being able to visualise parallel edges is a necessity. In this post I discuss some of the details of visualising parallel edges using Qtâ€™s tools for visualisation. For a visual impression of what parallel edges look like in Q-SoPrA, see the screenshot below.</p>
